# Revision of Use Cases and Plan for My DIY AI Internship

I've been using AI for a lot of different things but am learning this about the real challenge of applying AI technology to work. The problem we've been facing for a long time with the internet gets even worse with AI. The internet makes too much available. It's impossible to sort through it all and distinguish between what matters and what doesn't.

The AI version of this general internet problem is this: AI makes too many different tasks possible with promises of much less effort and time. How to decide between what I will do simply because it's possible to do it faster now with AI and what I actually think will be meaningful? Ethan Mollick calls this question of the meaning of work "setting time on fire" - see [this essay](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/setting-time-on-fire-and-the-temptation) about the loss of meaning when work can be done with AI.

What does this mean for me? I think I need to reset and not just define my use cases in terms of what I *can* get done with AI and measure how much faster I can do it without loss of quality. I need to give some thought to the meaning of the work I do and whether I can add AI to the work and still consider it meaningful. Here's what I have in mind right now after a week of working quite a lot with AI. Here's my thoughts about the rest of the internship.

I will commit to two things each day. The first one is pretty straightforward and uses AI in a focused way way as a writing assistant. The second is more complex and uses AI in different ways at once, for coding, planning, text translation, writing, and maybe some image generation and analysis.

1) Write a new blog post for my Build Little Worlds site each day. Use AI mostly for the writing itself.
2) Write a new blog post for my Memory Palace site. This is more complicated. Keep track of experimental AI-use for coding, writing, and whatever else I try.

I expect to use AI tools for a lot of other stuff. I'm constantly trying out new things with AI. But I will work hard to focus on these two and only browse and wander when I've finished the core AI use cases for the day.
