# Revision of Use Cases and Plan for My DIY AI Internship

I've been using AI for a lot of different things but am learning this about the real challenge of applying AI technology to work. The problem we've been facing for a long time with the internet gets even worse with AI. The internet makes too much available. It's impossible to sort through it all and distinguish between what matters and what doesn't.

The AI version of this general internet problem is this: AI makes too many different tasks possible with promises of much less effort and time. How to decide between what I will do simply because it's possible to do it faster now with AI and what I actually think will be meaningful? Ethan Mollick calls this question of the meaning of work "setting time on fire" - see [this essay](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/setting-time-on-fire-and-the-temptation) about the loss of meaning when work can be done with AI.

What does this mean for me? I think I need to reset and not just define my use cases in terms of what I *can* get done with AI and measure how much faster I can do it without loss of quality. I need to give some thought to the meaning of the work I do and whether I can add AI to the work and still consider it meaningful. Here's what I have in mind right now after a week of working quite a lot with AI. Here's my thoughts about the rest of the internship.
