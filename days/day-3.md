# Day 3 of My DIY AI Internship

Today I worked on building out a CV website as an example for a course I teach, showing students how to build "practical stuff" with AI.

Time savings - 4
Quality - 3 or 4

The quality wasn't amazing but I got a sense of how to make it better pretty easily. The time savings were quite something. I can see how this will be the way CV's and resumes will get built from now on.
