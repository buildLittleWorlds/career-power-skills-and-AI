# Day 2 of My DIY AI Internship

Today focused mostly on trying to code random app ideas to learn a new coding tool (to me) called Cursor and building out a couple parts of a three-part blog post about Um-Helat, the made-up world for a short story I teach.

Coding with Cursor (time saved - 1 or 5; quality - 3)
This is really strange. It's very hard to rate this time because I built a lot of stuff a lot faster than I could without AI, but none of it finally fit with what I was really wanting to do. So the quality was fine, but I pretty much wasted all the time I spent on this. By "wasted time" I mean I got distracted from things I need to build because I was messing around building things I don't really need -- like a silly game I built where the player is a flame at the bottom of the screen that burns up leaves falling from the sky. It worked, but it's not connected to any of my work.

Blog Posts (time saved - 3; quality - 4)
I think the work I produced was really quite good. I liked it. This time I went back and forth between writing parts of the posts myself and generating AI writing for other parts. So the time savings went down a bit because I did more writing "by hand," but the quality went up I think.
