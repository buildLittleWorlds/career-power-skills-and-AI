# Day 4 of My DIY AI Internship

This is been more of a detour than I expected. I've been trying to get a CV website built with code generated by Claude and hosted on Github Pages. The rating is a challenge. On the one hand, I was able to get it produced on my own very quickly at a quality level I could live with and probably tinker with over time. But in shooting videos about doing the work, I ran into more snags than when I did it on my own. So this brings up the problem of inconsistent results with AI. Sometimes they do one thing; sometimes they do something else.

Time spent - 2 (low rating here just because it's become a rabbit-hole project, pulling more time than I'd like, even though the actual work can be done very quickly with these tools)

Quality - 3
