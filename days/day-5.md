# Day 5 of My DIY AI Internship

See [Day 4](day-4.md)
The same thoughts apply. I created video showing myself using AI to do CV work and ran into more trouble. It's probably as much resulting from the on-screen building process as from the difficult of the tools themselves.

Time spent - 2 (low rating here just because it's become a rabbit-hole project, pulling more time than I'd like, even though the actual work can be done very quickly with these tools)

Quality - 3
