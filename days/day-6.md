# Day 6 of My DIY AI Internship

I'm pausing today to think about the process. The disciplined focus on a few use cases has been harder to stick to than I expected. I think the general purpose ability of these tools is the problem. I've gotten to where I just have AI open and ready to use for whatever I happen to be doing. The last few posts have commented on the CV website, but I've been using AI for coding other things, doing research, asking about articles I find online, and other stuff.

So I'm not sure how to best re-focus. My impulse is to choose just one use case and record my process with that use case even though I'm using AI for a lot of other things too. But the DIY AI thing is supposed to be about testing AI with a range of tasks.
