# Day 6 of My DIY AI Internship

Today was pretty exciting, but already I'm veering off-course from my "reset" idea. I will work really hard to get those two things done ([reset resolution](reset.md)), but I've been working on a note-taking and thought-organizing app that's really fun to build.

Here's what happened. I was making my morning breakfast smoothies, listening to this [Hard Fork podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYCPc0sfv1k&t=3576s), and one of the guys started talking about a note-taking system called [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/), and I was intrigued. So I quit making breakfast and looked up the Zettelkasten method and got pretty excited. Then I found the app/note-taking tool they recommended, which is only $20, so that's a possible purchase. Then I found the training, workshop thing they do, which would put the total cost up around $400. That's more then I want to pay on a rabbit-hole. So that was a downer.

Then I thought, why not just ask Claude if it knows about Zettelkasten? And Claude did. Then I asked Claude to help me start building the app. And we've been working on it. This is my workflow:

1) Type in the next prompt to Claude and ask Claude to generate the code;
2) While Claude generates the Python code, keep working on slicing strawberries, preparing kefir and bananas for the smoothies;
3) Glance over and test out the new code generated by Claude. Ask for some new feature for the note-taking app and ask for generated code;
4) Go back to smoothie-fixing while Claude spits out the next code.

Using this method, I had a functional Zettelkasten note-taking and organizing app completed by the time I finished the smoothies. (Actually, the app was done first.)

Time savings - an amazing 5!
Quality - seems like a 4 or 5 to me so far
