# Day 1 of My DIY AI Internship

Day 1 was an interesting day. I generated a blog post with Claude for my [Build Little Worlds](https://www.buildlittleworlds.com/) site. And I spent time brainstorming a simplified example of my "strange scholarship" work, feeding explanations of things into Claude to help it (and me) see what my goals are and generate possible real work I could produce. I also generated enough code with Claude to get a basic thing up and running [here](#).

Off to a good start, I think!
