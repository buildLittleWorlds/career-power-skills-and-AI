# The 90-Day AI Evaluation System

- Pilot your use of AI tools over a 90-day period
  Find a 90-day stretch when you can implement this process in a disciplined, consistent way. Do not start it until you are committed to following through.

- Identify 3-5 use cases
  The use cases should be tasks or components of projects that recur frequently during your work week. Use cases must be small enough to be defined clearly and evaluated when completed.

4. Actually use AI for those use cases _every time you do them_

It's wonderful to try AI for as many things as possible and use the tools all the time. This will result in improved ability with AI and better productivity. But _this process_ will fail if you do not make sure you keep the 3-5 use cases in mind on a daily basis. Be ok with not using AI for anything else. For these 90 days, just make sure you do this: every time you perform one of your 3-5 use cases, use AI to assist with the work.

5. Keep at least some quantitative record of how well AI is working in those use cases

This can be a simple 5 point scale for how effective the AI tool is for the given task. It can also be a quantitative evaluation + a simple write-up of your thoughts about that particular task.

6. Be very cautious about changing the use cases part-way through

It may be necessary to swap out one or even two of your use cases for better candidate tasks after 10 or 15 days of the process. If this is obviously necessary, then make the change. The bottom line is to make sure this evaluation process measures the work you actually do most frequently. **But be very cautious about making a change**. Think very hard and honestly about step #2. The better you evaluate the importance and frequency of your use cases, the more likely you will be to stick with those use cases for the full 90 days.
