# Setting Up My 90-day AI Evaluation System

Step #1
Identify my power skills

Step #2
Identify candidate use cases (about 20 possibilities)

Step #3
Winnow down the list of use cases in terms of
- frequency
- importance to my work

Step #4
Identify relevant AI tools for use cases

Step #5
Write up evalution forms
- anything that can be done up front that reduces work during the process will make it more likely to succeed
- make the forms simple
- make the forms at least partially quantitative

Step #6
Move on to Day #1 - do not stop until Day #90 (or #45 if you're doing the speed route)
