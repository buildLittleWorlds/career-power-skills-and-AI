# Setting Up My 90-day AI Evaluation System

[Step #1](plan/step-1.md)
Identify my power skills

[Step #2](plan/step-2.md)
Identify candidate use cases (15+ possible use cases)

[Step #3](plan/step-3.md)
Winnow down the list of use cases in terms of
- frequency
- importance to my work
- plausible effectiveness of AI for the task (this has to be guessed at to some degree; the point of the process is to learn the answer)

[Step #4](plan/step-4.md)
Customize your prompting for the use cases and AI tools
- curate multiple context streams that can be used reliably for use cases
- build up annotated examples and annotated processes to improve prompting outputs
- [include anything else from the [from poetry to programming podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjaSyLHOUb0)]

[Step #5](plan/step-5.md)
Describe in concrete detail the data-capture method
- anything that can be done up front that reduces work during the process will make it more likely to succeed
- make the process as simple as possible
- make the data at least partially quantitative

[Step #6](plan/step-6.md)
If at all possible, create a schedule for performing your use cases on a daily or at least weekly basis.

[Step #7](days/day1.md)
Move on to Day #1 - do not stop until Day #90 (or #45 if you're doing the speed route)
