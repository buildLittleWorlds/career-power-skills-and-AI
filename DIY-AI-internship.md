# The 90-Day AI Evaluation as a Self-Paced, DIY AI Internship

This is the heart of the process for anyone early on in their career or building toward a career as a student. It is possible, with a few tweaks, to re-imagine the 90-day AI evaluation process as a do-it-yourself (DIY) internship in using AI. With some self-promotion (like keeping a blog or _even a Github repository record_ like [this one](day-by-day.md)), this internship can be added to a CV or resume.

_Note for any students of Professor Dan Plate: I will provide evidence of completion of the DIY AI Internship for any students enrolled in a course with me or for any advisees or students I am mentoring who complete the 90-day process under my supervision. **If you are interested in this, make sure you let me know in writing of your intentions.**_

Here are the basics of how to turn your 90 days into a DIY internship:

1. Identify 3-5 use cases that are organized around career-related tasks
2. Complete the use cases in a way that results in tangible products
3. Keep records and quantitative data of your work
4. Ideally, build in public as you do this work (see the "self-promotion" note above)
