# The 90-Day AI Evaluation as a Self-Paced, DIY AI Internship

This is the heart of the process for anyone early on in their career or building toward a career as a student. It is possible, with a few tweaks, to re-imagine the 90-day AI evaluation process as a do-it-yourself (DIY) internship in using AI. With some self-promotion (like keeping a blog or even a Github repository record like [this one](day-by-day.md)), this internship can be added to a CV or resume.

_Note for any students of Professor Daniel Plate: I will provide evidence of completion of the DIY AI Internship for any students enrolled in a course with me or for any advisees or students I am mentoring who complete the 90-day process under my supervision. **If you are interested in this, make sure you let me know in writing of your intentions.**_

Here are the basics of how to turn your 90 days into a DIY internship:

1. Identify 3-5 use cases that are organized around career-related tasks

   This can be difficult for a student or someone early on in their career. Just be as creative and disciplined as possible in grouping the work you do around a single purpose. This is where the power skills can be especially helpful. Be very intentional about connecting the power skills you have developed as a student in the Humanities with one or two kinds of consistent work you do each week.
2. Complete the use cases in a way that results in tangible products

   This is essential. The use cases cannot simply be ideas or things you plan on doing or fragments of things you started but did not finish. Anything you count as the accomplishment of a use case must have a tangible thing you can cut-and-paste into a blog post or upload as a file. In cases where you are concerned about privacy, make sure you could _at least in theory_ provide a document or product of some kind.
3. Keep records and quantitative data of your work

   This goes along with #2. It's a matter of discipline and developing a consistent practice. It does take a little extra time at the end of a task to evaluate it, but if you put the time in, you will have a reliable record of where AI contributes to your work in a tangible way and where it does not justify the cost or time spent.
4. Ideally, build in public as you do this work (see the "self-promotion" note above)

   Keep a blog of your work. Develop a repository or archive of your work such as [this Github repository](day-by-day.md). You would be surprised at how "official" a DIY project such as this can end up being in providing tangible proof of an impressive kind to a potential employer or current boss. (In the case of a boss, I recommend running the project by your higher-up early on just in case there are privacy concerns.)
