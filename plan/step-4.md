# Customizing Context and Work Flows for Each Use Case

This step is the only one that will not be finished when you start the 90-day process. It is a good idea to start thinking about sources that you draw on regularly for your work and the sequence of your tasks, but you will be refining and iterating on these things, especially during the first few weeks of the project.


## Use Case #1 - Learn about a new philosophical topic

Sources here will be articles or books of philosophy I am reading for myself; Youtube videos with philosophical content; readings assigned for my World Literature course, which has quite a bit of philosophical content; and other online sources like the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Wikipedia articles.

AI tools I expect to use most for this are Perplexity and Claude, but I will keep my eye out for other research tools.

More to come about prompting processes and context stream management.


## Use Case #2 - Break world-building idea down into component parts

Sources here will be content generated by AI, probably Claude. I expect to take the conversations with Claude from #1 that are most fruitful, push them into rough draft material for a blog post, and then bring that to this use case as the starting point.

AI tools I expect to use most for this are Claude and maybe Perplexity. I will probably keep practicing with different ways to prompt Claude to get it to decompose topics down to tight little world-building atoms.

## Use Case #3 - Create blog post from video about a topic

Sources here will be whatever Claude generates for #2 and the video I shoot based on that content. Some follow-up reading of relevant content online might be brought in after the video is shot, but I'm not sure about that.

I expect to use Claude for the most part. Probably this will involve grabbing the transcript from the video after I shoot it, feeding the transcript to Claude and asking Claude to clean it up, remove timestamps, and put it into prose. Then I will give Clause some example blog posts I like and ask Claude to convert the transcript prose into something with a similar style and format as the example posts.

More to come about prompting processes and context stream management.


## Use Case #4 (and #5?) - Change design element on blog

Sources here are simply the blog itself and my observations about things I want to change. Also sources will be coding documentation I provide to the coding assistant AI.

I plan to use Claude for this as long as it continues to be the best coding assistant out there.
