# Customizing Context and Work Flows for Each Use Case

This step is the only one that will not be finished when you start the 90-day process. It is a good idea to start thinking about sources that you draw on regularly for your work and the sequence of your tasks, but you will be refining and iterating on these things, especially during the first few weeks of the project.


## Use Case #1 - Create blog post from video about a topic



## Use Case #2 - Break world-building idea down into component parts

This might seem strange as a use case, but I think it could end up being a very important way to streamline my writing process. One problem with AI writing is vagueness. It's common for AI tools to stay too high-level with a writing task and not provide nitty-gritty detail. So what I want to be able to do is take a draft of AI-written content about some world-building topic and then use AI to find the "atoms" of that topic from a practical, world-building perspective.

What I would expect this to result in is a tight "build little world" post, a post that is sufficiently focused and narrow to work as a post for my blog. I don't want the blog to be full of general reflections on world-building. I want it to be full of "world-building atoms" that can be combined into interesting creative structures to imagine worlds.


## Use Case #3 - Learn about a new philosophical topic

This is something I do frequently but probably quite inefficiently. I read about philosophical things, think about them, and then get yanked in some new direction. I want to develop a task-oriented process for learning enough about a new philosophical topic that I have a blog post idea at the other end. This will mean using a general conversational tool like Claude to discuss the topic and pinpoint things I don't understand, and it will involve experimenting with the AI research tools available for philosophical sources. It will probably also involve using transcripts of Youtube videos because that's one way I get pulled into thinking about philosophical stuff.

## Use Case #4 - Change design element on blog
