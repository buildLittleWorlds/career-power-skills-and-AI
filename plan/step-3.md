# Choosing the 3-5 Use Cases

This is the key step. I have to move from the ~20 use cases from [step 2](step-2.md) to the best 3-5 for my AI evaluation project. This does not necessarily mean choosing the 3-5 things I enjoy the most or care about the most.

## This is the starting list

1. research blog post
2. write blog post
3. change design element on blog
4. automate blog post processes
5. write email
6. find images for blog
7. add additional functionality to blog
8. learn about a new philosohpical topic
9. summarize Youtube video
10. create presentation from blog post
11. create blog post from lecture video
12. create quiz from lecture video
13. create presentation from quiz and quiz answers
14. create possible goals or tasks from Teams meeting
15. add archive material to website (shift from blog-only)
16. break complex world-building idea down into component parts

## Here's how I winnow it down

I clearly need something to do with writing blog posts or drafts of blog posts.

I need something about transforming one kind of content into another (items 10-14).

I need something related to coding and managing, building, maintaining the website.


### Use Case #1 - Learn about a new philosophical topic

This is something I do frequently but probably quite inefficiently. I read about philosophical things, think about them, and then get yanked in some new direction. I want to develop a task-oriented process for learning enough about a new philosophical topic that I have a blog post idea at the other end. This will mean using a general conversational tool like Claude to discuss the topic and pinpoint things I don't understand, and it will involve experimenting with the AI research tools available for philosophical sources. It will probably also involve using transcripts of Youtube videos because that's one way I get pulled into thinking about philosophical stuff.


### Use Case #2 - Break world-building idea down into component parts

This might seem strange as a use case, but I think it could end up being a very important way to streamline my writing process. One problem with AI writing is vagueness. It's common for AI tools to stay too high-level with a writing task and not provide nitty-gritty detail. So what I want to be able to do is take a draft of AI-written content about some world-building topic and then use AI to find the "atoms" of that topic from a practical, world-building perspective.

What I would expect this to result in is a tight "build little world" post, a post that is sufficiently focused and narrow to work as a post for my blog. I don't want the blog to be full of general reflections on world-building. I want it to be full of "world-building atoms" that can be combined into interesting creative structures to imagine worlds.


### Use Case #3 - Create blog post from video about a topic

I really like the idea of automating or streamlining the process of creating a video about a topic, building a blog post from that video, building a presentation as well, and generating a quiz at some point along the way. This might be too many moving parts for a single use case. It would _definitely_ be multiple tasks and a long process without AI, but I wonder if creating the workflow itself could be the point.

One thing I'm a big confused about is what would count as the starting point. Would I start with the video and move to the blog post and presentation and quiz? Or would I want the presentation in order to shoot the video, which would mean starting with the blog post probably. But my hunch is that a way to speed up the process is to shoot the video, capture the transcript of the video, convert the transcript into prose for the blog post, and then get the presentation from that. So I don't know.

For now, I'll keep it as simple as possible and then add in more steps as I go.


### Use Case #4 - Change design element on blog

I am pretty poor when it comes to visual design. I don't want to put the time in that is required to become a web designer, but I do want to make the blog presentable. My plan is to keep a minimalist look, but I also plan on using images in the blog posts, and I know that can get complicated, so I will use AI to help me with the coding and planning.

This use case is pretty straightforward. Anytime I notice something I don't like about the visual state of the blog, I will use AI to brainstorm and implement a fix.


### (???) Use Case #5 - Add functionality to website

I'm not sure yet whether I want this to be just a blog or involve some other functionality for users. This uncertainty probably means this is not yet a chosen use case, but it might end up being one. So I've got it on here as a possibility.
