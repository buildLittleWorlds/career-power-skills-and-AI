# Choosing the 3-5 Use Cases

This is the key step. I have to move from the ~20 use cases from [step 2](step-2.md) to the best 3-5 for my AI evaluation project. This does not necessarily mean choosing the 3-5 things I enjoy the most or care about the most.

## This is the starting list

1. research blog post
2. write blog post
3. change design element on blog
4. automate blog post processes
5. write email
6. find images for blog
7. add additional functionality to blog
8. learn about a new philosohpical topic
9. summarize Youtube video
10. create presentation from blog post
11. create blog post from lecture video
12. create quiz from lecture video
13. create presentation from quiz and quiz answers
14. create possible goals or tasks from Teams meeting
15. add archive material to website (shift from blog-only)
16. 

## Here's how I winnow it down

I clearly need something to do with writing blog posts or drafts of blog posts.

I need something about transforming one kind of content into another (items 10-14).

I need something related to coding and managing, building, maintaining the website.
