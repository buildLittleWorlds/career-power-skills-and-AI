# Define and Describe Data Gathering Process

This should not be highly formal or intricate. It's just important to have a concrete system for entering data so you don't have to think about it at the end of performing each use case. It's hard enough to take that extra time to rate your work; you don't want to burden yourself with having to think about how to manage data later.

My process is pretty easy to define. I will use these two simple 5 point grades each time I perform each of my use cases:
   - How much time did AI save me? (1 - no time savings; 5 - 10x the speed or even better)
   - How high was the quality of the result? (1 - seriously sub-standard compared to work without AI; 5 - significantly better than work without AI)

I will keep a Google spreadsheet with these scores in it and make sure I enter each score each time I get done with a use case.
