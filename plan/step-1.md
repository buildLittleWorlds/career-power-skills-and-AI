# My Power Skills

These are the skills I've got with hints along the way of tangible work I do frequently during my week.

Creativity - this is near the top of the list. I invent and create things all the time. This is what I teach, so I hope it's a skill. The jury's still out on whether generative AI tools are _actually_ creative or just good imitators of creativity, but I'd love to experiment in a more methodical way and find out.

Flexibility - I'm probably _too_ flexible, meaning I'm willing to shift my focus on a moment's notice and give up on months of work because some new thing catches my eye. But it is a strength as well. I hope the 90-day process will keep me focused and let my flexibility work within some constraints.

Critical thinking - my career has been a mix of disciplines; my goal has always been to combine philosophical thinking with creative world-building. My plan is to do a lot of what I think of as "component building," which means breaking larger chunks of work down into atomic pieces. So I'd like to find a use case or two that are focused on breaking complex thinking down into smaller units. I think that's critical thinking.

Empathy and communication - these go together, I figure. I think I'm good at intuiting the emotional complexities of a situation (especially an imaginary situation) and communicating those complexities to someone else. I'm fascinated by how well AI tools might help with this process. I know there's something called "sentiment analysis," which means an AI judging the emotional tone of something. So I'd like to think of a use case involving this skill.
