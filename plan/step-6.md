# Create Schedule for Doing the Work

For me this looks a bit more like planning out a sequence than actually writing down a schedule with days and times. I hope to do most of my use cases daily or every other day, so the sequence should repeat each day or over the course of a couple days depending on how busy I am.

1. Learn philosophical topic - learning comes before writing so this is pretty obvious
2. Break general world-building idea down into "world-building atoms" - this I think will also generally happen before writing or shooting any video
3. Build blog post from video - my plan is to shoot a video about whatever I come up with after #1 and #2; this video can then be converted hopefully into a blog post and any other content I want to generate
4. Coding work - I already know enough coding to get things up on the site in a basic way. Any additional coding work would be further refinements or troubleshooting at the end of the content creation process
