# Create Schedule for Doing the Work

For me this looks a bit more like planning out a sequence than actually writing down a schedule with days and times. I hope to do most of my use cases daily or every other day, so the sequence should repeat each day or over the course of a couple days depending on how busy I am.

In general, I think the schedule will be something like

- notice something in scholarly stuff I am reading
- develop this with the help of AI into blog post material
- notice things I'd like to improve about the blog from a coding perspective while I get the latest post up online
- at other times in the day, time permitting, tinker with other "strange scholarship" work and use AI + coding to help with the planning and brainstorming
