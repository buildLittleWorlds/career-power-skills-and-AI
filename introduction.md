# Introduction to Your Career Power Skills and AI

Welcome! This is your guide to building a process that will make the most of the power skills you have developed as a student in a field in the Humanities. This guide will also be relevant to students outside the Humanities (as long as you get creative about identifying some similar power skills you've picked up along the way). It will also be useful to anyone early on in their career who wants a method for testing the very tangible usefulness of AI for their career goals. Finally, this guide will be exciting and valuable for anyone well established in their career who has a spirit of experimentating and innovation and wants to see what is possible.

## Power Skills and Artificial Intelligence

From here on, this guide will speak to you as a student in the Humanities. Interpret this for yourself however you choose.

One of the remarkable changes of the last five-to-ten years has been an increasing awareness in many sectors of the economy that preparation in fields in the Humanities offer students a serious, rigorous, and flexibe set of skills for successs. With the advent of new AI tools in 2022, this awareness has been solidified into recruiting candidates for jobs with backgrounds in English, creative writing, history, political science, foreign languages, philosophy, religion, and other related fields. These fields train students to think in ways that are highy attuned to language, emotional complexity, constantly shifting circumstances, and highly rigorous patterns of critical thinking. As soon as large language models (LLMs) emerged in 2022, it became clear that "the new programming language is English." What this means is that workers who can intuit deep complexities within human communication are very well positioned for both workplace communication and interactions with AI tools that increasingly use natural language as their medium.

It is time to explore your power skills as a student in the Humanities and maximize your potential for whatever career you choose to explore. There is no barrier to entry for someone who can think, feel, reason, and do so with deep ethical awareness.

A significant part of this process is getting down to the practical business of applying these power skills to the new technologies being offered by artificial intelligence companies. It is not enough to know in theory that your power skills are valuable. You need to practice using them in the sorts of concrete contexts that will eventually become your career.

## On the Importance of a Methodical Approach

It is easier said than done, however. How does one actually "apply power skills to a new technology?" This guide and the pages that follow will lay out a concrete, data-informed process for making it happen. The key is to decide you want to do it.

If you have about 90 days (45 days if you want to take the speed route) and you have the drive, you can follow a simple but powerful method for identifying your core power skills; aiming these power skills at tangible career use cases; familiarizig yourself with AI tools relevant for your use cases; developing a data-based method for evaluating the value of these tools for each use case; and presenting (to yourself and to a potential employer) the upside you have found at the end of the process.

This is the DIY AI Internship.
