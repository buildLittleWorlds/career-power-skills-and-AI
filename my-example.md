# My Example for the DIY AI Internship

My example is quite straightforward. I teach undergraduate courses in creative writing, literature, composition, and applied AI. Most of what I do involves writing in one form or another. So all my use cases will fit somewhere into the writing process.

In order to avoid data privacy issues, I will not include specific examples of teaching use cases (such as providing feedback on student writing). Instead I will focus my use cases on public-facing writing where privacy is not an issue. For this purpose, I will start building a blog with frequent blog posts related to creative writing, world-building, and AI. My DIY AI internship will be my attempt to make blog development, including both coding the blog and writing content for the blog, augmented as effectively as possible by AI tools I discover during the 90-day period.

The blog is titled Build Little Worlds, and it is [here](https://www.buildlittleworlds.com/).
