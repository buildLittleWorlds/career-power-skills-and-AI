# My Example for the DIY AI Internship

This is a brief introduction to the example 90-day AI evaluation project I am conducting, both to test the process myself and to model it. I have decided not to choose use cases from my actual job but instead to model the process using an early-career writer and content creator in an imaginary "world" I have invented for this Github repository and for my (real) World-Building and Creating Imaginary Worlds courses. This page explains the "world" of this young man and the career goals and projects he is engaged in. The "setting it up" page will provide more nuts-and-bolts descriptions of the 3-5 use cases my imaginary person has identified for the evaluation process.

## Meet Moose

Moose graduated in 2022 with a major in creative writing and philosophy. He's pretty obsessed with exploring as many world-building ideas and frameworks for creating things. He works part-time as a technical writer and has started a blog to explore his world-building interests. He hopes to combine his technical writing work with content creation and build resources for creative people of all sorts. So far, he's not sure how to monetize all this, so the blog is the starting point for career explorations.

Moose is also one of those people whose life was transformed in November of 2022 (just a few months after graduating) by the dropping of Chat-GPT into his world as a content creator. Suddenly, these new AI tools threatened to do most of what he planned to do using his own wits and creativity. He had a decision to make, whether to stand against these tools as an intrusion into the uniqueness of human creation and an economic disaster for anyone with writing and creative ambitions; OR to attempt to learn the tools and see how they could enhance his work.

He chose the latter.

## Moose's Blog

Moose has a passion for breaking things down into smaller parts. He's also curious about different forms language might take. For his blog, he's decided to zoom in tight on a single world-building idea and keep creating small versions of that idea. The idea comes from the simple what-if question, "What if telepathy existed?"

Moose did not know how to code when he graduated. He was pretty tech-phobic outside of basic social media stuff. But he realized pretty early on after Chat-GPT arrived that he could learn enough coding to move away from tools such as WordPress, Squarespace, or Wix that provide templated and pretty standardized web platforms for creators. He could learn HTML, CSS, some Javascript, how to use Github, and perhaps some Python. He could actually become decent enough with code to manage his own career.

So this is what he did. He started a blog ([available here](https://www.buildlittleworlds.com/)), and he started building out content.

## Moose's Need for the 90-Day AI Evaluation Project

So Moose has a few important traits for our purposes (breaking the 4th wall now):

- he has some consistent things he does that involve important Humanities power skills (creativity, adaptability, empathy, collaboration (did I mention he has a few part-time contributors to the blog?))
- he has a steady purpose for his work, even if it is not completely formalized by a job description (and pay)
- he has used AI, but he has never actually attempted to evaluate where it provides true value and where it simply promises value but perhaps under-delivers

Taken together, these traits make Moose the ideal candidate for starting his own DIY AI internship.
