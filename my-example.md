# My Example for the DIY AI Internship

This is a brief introduction to the example 90-day AI evaluation project I am conducting, both to test the process myself and to model it. I have decided not to choose use cases from my actual job but instead to model the process using an early-career writer and content creator in an imaginary "world" I have invented for this Github repository and for my (real) World-Building and Creating Imaginary Worlds courses. This page explains the "world" of this young man and the career goals and projects he is engaged in. The "setting it up" page will provide more nuts-and-bolts descriptions of the 3-5 use cases my imaginary person has identified for the evaluation process.

## Meet Moose

Moose graduated in 2022 and is hard at work building out writing projects and online content for the career he wants for himself as a blog writer and perhaps a technical writer or  journalist. Moose grew up in Nigeria and moved to the United States as a high school student. He studied creative writing and philosophy as an undergraduate and is attempting to bridge his background living in Nigeria with his current interests in philosophy, creativity, political theory, writing, and content creation.

Moose is also one of those people whose life was transformed in November of 2022 (just a few months after graduating) by the dropping of Chat-GPT into his world as a content creator. Suddenly, these new AI tools threatened to do most of what he planned to do using his own wits and creativity. He had a decision to make, whether to stand against these tools as an intrusion into the uniqueness of human creation and an economic disaster for anyone with writing and creative ambitions; OR to attempt to learn the tools and see how they could enhance his work.

He chose the latter.

## Moose's Blog

The blog itself is sort of a mess. What Moose really wants it to be is a resource for writers, artists, musicians, and other creative people who need help thinking about the worlds they make up. It's also supposed to be a life experiment in building in public. Moose wants to learn what it might mean to automate parts of the world-building process. He's heard about research in to the concept of AI agents, and he wants to see if this can translate into creating made-up worlds. He's not sure what this could mean, but it seems like a big deal, and Moose wants to show skeptics of AI and coding and tech in general how the world of creativity can interact with the new world of AI agents.

Moose did not know how to code when he graduated. He was pretty tech-phobic outside of basic social media stuff. But he realized pretty early on after Chat-GPT arrived that he could learn enough coding to move away from tools such as WordPress, Squarespace, or Wix that provide templated and pretty standardized web platforms for creators. He could learn HTML, CSS, some Javascript, how to use Github, and perhaps some Python. He could actually become decent enough with code to manage his own career.

So this is what he did. He started a blog ([available here](https://www.buildlittleworlds.com/)), and he started building out content.

## Moose's Need for the 90-Day AI Evaluation Project

So Moose has a few important traits for our purposes (breaking the 4th wall now):

- he has some consistent things he does that involve important Humanities power skills (creativity, adaptability, empathy, collaboration (did I mention he has a few part-time contributors to the blog?))
- he has a steady purpose for his work, even if it is not completely formalized by a job description (and pay)
- he has used AI, but he has never actually attempted to evaluate where it provides true value and where it simply promises value but perhaps under-delivers

Taken together, these traits make Moose the ideal candidate for starting his own DIY AI internship.
